##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't struggling with any concept in particular but I did learn some new things.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I learned the differnce between fetch and pull and how to properly merge.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

When it came to testing out some markdown skills, we were both able to share some of our own knowledge as well as come up with some conclusions together. Some examples being, adding links, pictures, ordered and unordered lists. Our Guide even clarified one question we had about code blocks and how we can actualy add working code to these blocks.

##What still confuses you about git?

Git will always be a learning experience. I'm comfortable with what I know so far but I don't necessarily know yet all the things that I have to learn. I guess we can't really know what we don't know.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

This was a great first experience overall. I came into this a bit nervous about how much knowledge I have that I could use to make a meaningful contribution. Our guide was very open to letting us work out our process and my guide and I were there to help one another when one of us got stuck. Overall a great first experience and looking forward to many more to come!
