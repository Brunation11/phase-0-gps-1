##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I was not struggling with any git concepts per se, but this excercise definitely helped me in getting more familiar and comfortable navigating the commands.
##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  The concept git pull vs. fetch/merge was clarified by our guide. Moreover, a lot of new tools for markdown was introduced, and we were able to implement some of the markdown tools that neither of us has tried in the past.
##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I was quite unfamiliar with the markdown commands. Thankfully my partner was able to guide me through it. He did a great job navigating me when I was driving.
##What still confuses you about git?
  Nothing confuses me particularly. But I am sure there is always more to learn about git. Also with time I hope to gain more proficiency using git.
##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  It was great. At the beginning I was a little nervous in sharing my thought process and found it quite difficult to do. But as I was going through the commands, I found it very useful to have a great navigator to guide me through whichever part I was confused about. It turned out to be very efficient and we learned a lot through the process.
